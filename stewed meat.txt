    2 celery
    Celery

    sticks, thickly sliced
    1 onion
    Onion

    , chopped
    2 really big carrot

    , halved lengthways then very chunkily sliced
    5 bay leaf

    Butter

    2 tbsp plain flour
    2 tbsp tomato puree
    2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
    2 beef stock cube, crumbled
    850g stewing beef (featherblade or brisket works nicely), cut into nice large chunks



Method

    Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Put the kettle on. Put the celery, onion, carrots, bay and 1 thyme sprig in a casserole with 1 tbsp oil and the butter. Soften for 10 mins, then stir in the flour until it doesn’t look dusty anymore, followed by the tomato puree, Worcestershire sauce and beef stock cubes.

    Gradually stir in 600ml hot water, then tip in the beef and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and put in the oven for 2hrs 30 mins, then uncover and cook for 30mins – 1hr more until the meat is really tender and the sauce is thickened.
